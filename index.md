The ASU COVID-19 Case Investigation Team follows up with cases who tested positive within the county of Maricopa. The team transitioned from what used to be ASU’s Student Outbreak Response Team (SORT), in March 2020, when the COVID-19 virus broke out further within the county.  The Maricopa County Department of Public Health went on to partner with the ASU COVID-19 Case Investigation Team in order to call cases who had tested positive for contact tracing purposes. 
Our team works virtually and continues to carry-out out interviews with confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases and allocates resources wherever needed, be it mentally, medically, financially or otherwise. 

The ASU COVID-19 Case Investigation Team is led by Dr. Megan Jehn, the principal investigator.
